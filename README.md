**Falling Leaves Animation project**

This project creates a visually appealing autumn leaf fall animation for web pages. 

The JavaScript code handles the dynamic creation and management of leaf elements, while CSS animations ensure smooth, realistic movement. 
A mask effect is also used to enhance the visual depth of the scene, making the animation feel more immersive and engaging.

1. **Dynamic leaf generation:** JavaScript is used to create and manage falling leaves with random sizes, positions, and speeds.

2. **CSS Animations:** The fall keyframes animation provides realistic movement with rotation and scaling effects.

3. **Visual Depth:** A CSS mask effect adds texture and depth, making the animation feel more immersive.

4. **CSS Variables:** CSS variables are used for easy adjustments to animation properties like duration, delay, and scale.
